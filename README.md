#### Inspired by the addictive game (original game available on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/water-sort-puzzle/id1514542157) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gma.water.sort.puzzle&hl=en_US&gl=US)), I recrated this game with Unity. Now, let's try to sort the colored waters until all colors are in one single bottle.

## How to play?
Click on one bottle and then another to pour the water. The action is successful when they have the same top color and the second bottle has available space, or the second bottle is empty. Note that, please wait for the current pouring animation to finish to click next bottle or button.

## Reset
You can restart the game at any time.

## Undo
If the current action is not leading to a success, you can always undo it (for unlimited number of times until the initial game state) and try an alternative.

## Add Extra Bottle
Too hard to solve? Just add an extra empty bottle for your convenience. Resetting the game will not remove the extra empty bottle.

## Solve
Still struggling? The solve button can help out by automatically pouring the waters for you. The extra empty bottle will be removed if added earlier.

## Play on and on!
Once a level is passed, you can select the next level with desired difficulty. Easy level has 6 bottles, medium level has 9 bottles, and hard level has 12 bottle. Keep playing on with the endless challenges!
